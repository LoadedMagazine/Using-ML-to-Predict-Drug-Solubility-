# Using-ML-to-Predict-Drug-Solubility-
This project uses machine learning to enhance drug solubility predictions. A genetic algorithm selected optimal features, followed by single and multi-model strategies. The piecewise linear model significantly improved accuracy, providing a robust solution for pharmaceutical research and lowering drug development costs.
